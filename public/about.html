<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Jubei Kibagami is the main protagonist of the 1993 anime movie Ninja Scroll.
  He is a wandering ninja in feudal Japan and a former member of the Tokagawa government</p>

<p>While investigating the deaths, a Mochizuki Kōga ninja team is massacred by the Devils. 
  The sole survivor, the kunoichi Kagero (陽炎, Kagerō), is captured by a Devil, Tessai (鉄斎, Tessai), who attempts to rape her. 
  She is rescued by Kibagami Jubei (牙神 獣兵衛, Kibagami Jūbē), a mercenary ex-Yamashiro ninja, who fights and eventually kills Tessai. 
  </p>

  <p>Dakuan (濁庵, Dakuan), a Tokugawa spy, blackmails Jubei into helping him kill the remaining Devils. 
    To ensure his compliance, Dakuan stabs Jubei with a poisoned shuriken, and promises to give him an antidote once the mission is complete. 
    Jubei learns from Dakuan that the leader of the Devils is Himuro Gemma (氷室 弦馬, Himuro Genma), the former Yamashiro ninja leader, who had ordered his team's members to kill each other to cover up the location of the goldmine five years earlier. <br>

    Jubei, who had been forced to kill his comrades to survive, decapitated Gemma in revenge; Gemma survived due to his immortality. Jubei is attacked by another Devil, Benisato (紅里, Benisato), but he is saved by Kagero; before she can be questioned, Benisato is killed from afar by Yurimaru (百合丸, Yurimaru), Gemma's right-hand man, for failing her mission. Kagero agrees to work alongside Jubei and Dakuan, who informs Jubei that her body is infused with such deadly toxins that anyone who kisses or sleeps with her dies, which was why Jubei could kill Tessai.</p>
  </p>

<p>The trio arrive in Shimoda, where they discover that the villagers died due to their water supply being poisoned, making it appear that they were killed by a plague. 
  Jubei and Kagero fend off attacks from three of the Devils – Mushizo (蟲蔵, Mushizō), Zakuro (石榴, Zakuro), and Utsutsu Mujuro (現 夢十郎, Utsutsu Mujūrō); Jubei succeeds in killing Mushizo and Utsutsu. 
  After finding the beached ship, Kagero deduces that the gold has been taken to Kashima Harbor, where it will be transported to the Shogun of the Dark in another ship.</p>
